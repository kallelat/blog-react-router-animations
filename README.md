# How to use CSS variables with React

This article demonstrates usage of CSS variables in a simple React app. It won't be covering advanced use cases, but hopefully a simple and short explanation on how and when to use CSS variables.

Technologies used:

- React with TypeScript
- React Router
- Plain CSS files imported to React

## Initial setup and configuration

1. Create a new React app with `npm create-react-app . --template typescript`
2. Install requires packages `npm install react-router-dom react-transition-group --save`
3. Install type definitions `npm install @types/react-transition-group --save-dev`
4. Start dev server using `npm start`
5. Use my [original code bundle](initial.zip) to start with or build your own
